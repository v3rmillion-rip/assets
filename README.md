# assets

![Logo](root/images/newlogo.png)

This repo contains a dump of the many assets which were added either from wayback machine or local caches.
The contents of the [/root/](/root/) directory can be copied to your MyBB installation which will resolve any assets referenced in the [V3rmillion template](https://github.com/v3rmillion-rip/template) or custom usergroups.
Keep in mind not everything in this repository was used e.g. archived themes.

You may also find the table schematics in [/tables/](/tables/).
