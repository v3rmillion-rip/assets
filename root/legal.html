		<h2 id="disc">Disclaimer</h2>
		Vermillion is strictly a gaming and programming community website. Having registered to this site, users have
		already agreed to the Vermillion Registration Agreement, a copy of which can be found <a href="https://v3rmillion.rip/legal.html#regagree">here</a>. By agreeing to the Registration Agreement, users have also agreed to follow the
		administrator-specified rules, which can be found <a href="https://v3rmillion.rip/rules.php">here</a>. The rules very clearly specify,
		among other important things, that the distribution of malicious content will result in the removal of the
		content, and may well result in the removal of the poster(s) as well. We encourage users to be aware of this in
		their posting.
		<br><br>We would like to make it clear that neither Vermillion nor its staff members are responsible for the
		actions nor posts of our users, both on and off the website. Our staff team is comprised entirely of unpaid
		volunteers who continue to work very hard to keep illegal, malicious, and unwanted content off of the website.
		We continue to work to improve our moderation and in turn the site experience for the community, but ask that
		all users and interested parties be understanding in the fact that we may not be able to get to everything
		immediately. If you do see a malicious post, please alert our staff members right away by clicking the "report"
		button, and this will make our jobs a lot easier. If the content breaks laws, copyrights, or infringes on
		personal information, users and non-users are encouraged to use our <a href="https://v3rmillion.rip/removals">content removal request
			form</a> to make us aware of it.

		<p style="color:#FA0707"><strong>Additional Data Storage Concerns</strong></p>

		<span style="text-decoration:underline">If the site team or administration can access some of my data, how can I
			know that their accounts are secure?</span>
		<ul>
			All staff members are thoroughly vetted by our hiring process and sign documents requiring that they never
			disclose any of your data. We also require that our team use multi-factor authentication and unique
			passwords on their accounts. We perform frequent security reviews to monitor their account security and data
			processing hygiene.
		</ul>
		<span style="text-decoration:underline">How is the database secured?</span>
		<ul>
			Our database is protected through several factors of authentication and can only be connected to over a
			secure connection by a few specific computers which are also protected by several factors of authentication.
			Intrusion attempts are monitored and investigated.
		</ul>

		<p style="color:#FA0707"><strong>How are identity discriminators processed?</strong></p>
		To identify malicious activity on our site, we maintain a log of discriminators like IP Addresses and
		automatically compare them to the discriminators of banned or new users. This helps us ensure transparency and
		public safety. While this data <strong>will never be shared</strong> with other, non-team members nor another
		third party, the other accounts that your site activity is closely related to will be listed publicly. We
		process this information as a matter of <strong>public safety.</strong>

		<p style="color:#FA0707"><strong>Who do you sell my data to, or share my data with?</strong></p>
		We will never sell or share the data we collect on you with any third party. We do however use Google AdSense
		and Google Analytics, which may collect data themselves. Please read below for more information on Google's data
		policies.

		<p style="color:#FA0707"><strong>Google AdSense &amp; Analytics</strong></p>

			consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
			services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br>
			<br>
			We collect information from children under 13 with parental consent.</p>

				an activity.</li>
			<li>Parents can review their child's personal information, direct us to delete it, and refuse to allow
				any further collection or use of the child's information.</li>
			<li>Parents can agree to the collection and use of their child's information, but still NOT allow
				disclosure to third-parties unless that's part of the service. Parents can review, delete, manage or
