# MySQL Table Imports

Be sure MyBB and all [plugins](https://github.com/v3rmillion-rip/mybb_plugins) are already properly installed before preceding as these scripts are adding upon **pre-existing** tables.

### List of schematics:
TODO


### What's not included
**UGC** (user-generated-content) such as threads, posts, profiles, reputation, ratings, and multi-account data are not included but can be separately imported using custom parsing scripts which process raw HTML from [the archive](https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22V3rmillion.rip+Team%22).

Please note that this is provided as-is and will not come with any support or guidance.
